CSS is added to HTML pages to format the document according to information in the style sheet. There are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.

1 -Inline CSS
2 -Internal CSS
3 -External CSS


1 = Inline CSS is used to apply CSS on a single line or element.
for exampel ;-
 <p style="color:blue">Hello CSS</p>   


 2 = Internal CSS : -
 Internal CSS is used to apply CSS on a single document or page. It can affect all the elements of the page. It is written inside the style tag within head section of html.

 For example-
 <style>  
     p{color:blue}  
 </style>


 3 = External CSS :- 
 External CSS is used to apply CSS on multiple pages or all pages. Here, we write all the CSS code in a css file. Its extension must be .css for example style.css.

 For example - 
 p{color:blue}  


 You need to link this style.css file to your html pages like this:

 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
